### 🧊Assignment #2 (Introduction to While-Loops): ▄︻デ11.25.2021══━一
Prompt the user to enter a number between 1 and 10. Ensure that the user entered a number between one and ten, otherwise tell them it is not a valid number and exit the program.
If the user entered a valid number, print a string of asterisks equal to the number the user entered on the first line and in each subsequent line reduce the number of asterisks 
by one until the last line has only one asterisks remaining. For example if the user entered 4, the output should look like this (with asterisks):

    . . . . 
                 
    . . .
                 
    . .
                 
    .
Finally, print a goodbye message to the user and tell them how many stars were shown on the screen in total. For the above example it will be 10.

### 🧊Assignment #7 (Introduction to Switch-Case Statements): ▄︻デ12.01.2021══━一
Prompt the user to enter an integer between zero and nine. Ensure that their input falls under these conditions, otherwise inform them that it is an invalid number and exit the program. If your program recognizes their input as a valid number, print their number as a word using a Switch-Case Statement. For example, the output would go as follows:

    3 ➜ Three
    
    8 ➜ Eight

Finally, print a goodbye message to the user thanking them.

    * "USA", "UK", "Australia", "Japan", "Singapore", "Sri Lanka", "France", "Canada".

       Then create a capitals ArrayList with the values:

    * "Washington DC", "London", "Canberra", "Tokyo", "Singapore", "Colombo", "Paris", "Ottowa".
Prompt the user to enter a country name from the list above. If the user enters a country that is not recognized on the list, inform them that they entered an invalid country and list the countries that the program can work with. Once the user enters a valid country, display the capital of that country.

### 🧊Assignment #9 (Practice of Every Concept Reviewed So Far): ▄︻デ12.03.2021══━一
Prompt the user to enter the names of their friends, one by one. You want to get multiple inputs in multiple occurences, under the same scanner. Set up a while loop and exit the while loop if the user entered "exit". Inside that while loop, do the following:

- Print a message asking the user to enter their next friend's name (This should only be used after they have entered at least one input.
- Store the entered name as the next element in an arraylist.

Outside the while loop, return the list of the user's friends. If the user has more than five friends, return a message in which you seem impressed. If the user has one friend, congratulate them for having a best friend. If the user has zero friends, offer to be their friend.

### 🧊Assignment #10 (Introduction to Functions + Working w/ Larger LOC's): ▄︻デ12.06.21══一
This application is for Boston University to maintain a list of all its students.

You will need to create three arraylists: student name, student grade, student gpa.
* Inside a while loop:

   - Print a message saying "Welcome to the BU Student Inventory System".
   
   - Print a bunch of "*" as an underline to the welcome banner.
   
   - Print the message: "Type one of the menu options: 1. Add a student  2. Remove a Student  3. Change Student Details 4. Statistics 5. Exit"
   
   - Read the users input; the input has to be 1,2,3,4 or 5. If they enter an invalid value then display the message:
    "Invalid option chosen", and redisplay the menu options.
   
   - If the user selected 5, exit the loop and the entire program with the final message: "You have successfully exited the student maintenance system. Have a great day!".
   
   - If they selected 1, call the function for adding a student.
   
   - If they selected 2, call the function for removing a student.
   
   - If they selected 3, call the function for updating a student's details.
   
   - If they selected 4, call the function for reporting the key statistics of the student body.
 
End of the loop.

* The add student function should do the following:

   - Print the message: "Adding new student. Please enter student's full name: ", and read the student name from user input and add it to the student name arraylist.
   
   - Print the message: "Please enter student's grade (between 9th and 12th grade): ", and read the student grade from user input and add it to the student grade
    arraylist after checking that it is a valid grade for BU.
    
   - Check that the input is between 9 and 12. If the input is outside that value, then add the student to 9th grade by default. 
   
   - Print the message: "Please enter the student's GPA (between 0 and 5.0): ", and read the GPA from the user input and add it to the gpa arraylist.
   
   - If the entered value is outside of 0 - 5.0, then set it to 3.5 by default.

* The remove student function should do the following:

  - Print the message: "Please enter the name of the student to be removed from BU:" and read the student fullname.
  
  - Search the student name arraylist to find the student name. If it does not exist in the list, then display the message: "Student NOT removed. 
   The student you entered is not enrolled in BU at this point", and exit the function.
  
  - If the student name exists in the arraylist, remove that element from the student name, student grade and gpa arraylists, and display the message:
   "Student successfully removed BU. We wish them the best!".

* The change student function should do the following:

    - Print the message: "Please enter the name of the student to be removed from BU: " and read the student fullname.
    
    - Search the student name arraylist to find the student name. If it does not exist in the list, display the message: "Student not found. The name 
     you entered does not belong to a student who is currently enrolled in BU at this point", and exit the function.
    
    - If the student name exists in the arraylist, print the message: "Please enter student's grade to change (between 9th and 12th grade): ", and read the 
     student grade from user input and update the student grade arraylist after checking if it is a valid grade for BU. 
      
    - Check that the input is between 9 and 12. If the input is outside that value, do not make any changes.
    
    - Print the message: "Please enter the student's GPA to change (between 0 and 5.0): ", and read the GPA from the user input and update the gpa arraylist after checking
      if it is a valid GPA for BU.
    
    - If the value is outside of 0 - 5.0, set the new GPA to 3.5 by default.
   
    - Print the message: "Student details successfully updated".

* The report stats function should do the following:

    - Print the message: "Here are the details of the students attending BU!".
    
    - Print the message: "These are the students who are performing well in school: ", and read through the three arraylists while searching for any students 
     with a GPA >= 4.0. 
    
    - At the end, display: "The total number of students with a GPA of 4.0 or better is: " + count. If there were none, display: "Unfortunately there are
     no students with a high GPA at this time at BU".
  
   - Print the message: "The average GPA of all BU students is: " + average. 
  
   - Print the message: "Total number of students currently enrolled at BU is: " + total student count.

### 🧊Assignment #14 (Reading and Locating Files from Harddrive): ▄︻デ1.31.2021══━一  
Create a text file and store it on your computer with the following values: 

                {Australia, Canberra},
                {New Zealand, Wellington},
                {China, Beijing},
                {USA, Washington DC},
                {UK, London},
                {Singapore, Singapore},
                {Japan, Tokyo},
                {Sri Lanka, Colombo},
                {Fiji, Suva},

Iterate through the text file in your code, row by row; store each row in an arraylist. You should have an arraylist for the name of the country and an arraylist
for the name of the capital of that corresponding country. Prompt the user to enter a country, then scan through the capitals arraylist and print the respective capital of the country.

* Error Handling: If the user gave an input that is not a country in the file, inform them that the program does not recognize their input and ask them to try again.

### 🧊Assignment #16 (Introduction to Recursion): ▄︻デ2.07.2021══━一  
For this assignment, you can use both recursion and while/for loop. Begin by prompting the user to enter any number between 1 and 9. For the number entered, calculate the sum of each number raised to its equal power. For example,
if the user entered "3", your calculation process should goes as follows:

    (1^1 + 2^2 + 3^3)

or if they entered "5":

    (1^1 + 2^2 + 3^3 + 4^4 + 5^5)
    
As mentioned, first try building this using for/while loops, then do so using recursion. Your final answer should be the summation of your calculation.

### 🧊Assignment #17 (Listing Files in a User's Directory): ▄︻デ2.13.2021══━一  
Prompt the user to input a folder/directory name from their computer by copying the path file of any location of their choice, as showed below:

    "C:\Users\JohnLovesMacaroni\Downloads"

Once receiving a directory from the user's PC, list out all the files and sub-folders within that directory. Include an error handling within your code for when the directory that the user entered cannot be found.

* Note: Keep in mind that the function of this program is to simply display all the files in a certain location of the user's PC. Therefore, only the user can run this program on their on computer, as it is not possible to access someone else's files without administrative permissions.

### 🧊Assignment #18 (Introduction to HashMaps): ▄︻デ2.13.2021══━一  
You are assigned to design a website with user profiles. Create a database of random usernames and passwords, as shown below:

    |      Username      |      Password      |
    |   "bobbyJoe1996"   |   "FluffyP0nies!"  |
    | "HelloKittyFan21"  |    "AloeVera?!"    |
    |   "coolguyswag"    |   "password123!"   |
    |  "PringleLover54"  |   "FluffyP0nies!"  |
    |  "FrenchBaguette"  |   "RIPGRAMPS2019!" |

Next, prompt the user to enter their desired username followed by a secure password. You will want to begin this assignment by initializing a HashMap and working from there. Look through the Java API for a list of HashMap commands/methods and see what you can put together.

* Error Handling: If the username already exists in the database, inform the user that the username is not available and let them try again. Once they have entered a unique username, make sure that their password is "secure" (you can set the paramaters for this as you like).

### 🧊Assignment #19 (Grasping a better understanding of HashMap commands): ▄︻デ2.13.2021══━一  
Using a HashMap, create a list of the first 16 US Presidents with their full name and year served in office, as shown below:

    |    "George Washington"   | "1789 - 1797" |
    |       "John Adams"       | "1797 - 1801" |
    |    "Thomas Jefferson"    | "1801 - 1809" |
    |      "James Madison"     | "1809 - 1817" |
    |       "James Monroe"     | "1817 - 1825" |
    |    "John Quincy Adams"   | "1825 - 1829" |
    |      "Andrew Jackson"    | "1829 - 1837" |
    |    "Martin van Buren"    | "1837 - 1841" |
    | "William Henry Harrison" | "1841 - 1841" |
    |       "John Tyler"       | "1841 - 1845" |
    |       "James Polk"       | "1845 - 1849" |
    |     "Zachary Taylor"     | "1849 - 1850" |    
    |    "Millard Fillmore"    | "1850 - 1853" |
    |     "Franklin Pierce"    | "1853 - 1857" |
    |      "James Buchanan"    | "1857 - 1861" |
    |     "Abraham Lincoln"    | "1861 - 1865" |    
    
* Display a message that welcomes to the user to the Presidential Database. 

    - Using a Scanner class, prompt the user to enter a President's full name, sequence, or year served in office.
    - Make a second scanner and gather data on which method the user would like to use to search for a President's info.
    - Once acquiring this data, explain to the user the format in which they need to enter a second input for one of the three options.
    - For example, for the President's full name, have them appropriately capitalize the first and last name and also include a space in between.
    - For the sequence, have the user enter the order in which the President was in office (ex: George Washington = 1).
    - For the year, have the user enter the four digit year that the President served their term(s) in.

* President's full name method:

      For this method, you will want to iterate through your HashMap using an enhanced for-loop. Decide on whether you 
      want to sort through the KeySets of the HashMap or the Values. Make sure that you include error handling for if
      the user input is not an existing President's name.

* President's year method:

      For this method, you will want to iterate through your HashMap using an enhanced for-loop. Decide on whether you 
      want to sort through the KeySets of the HashMap or the Values. You will want to approach the problem by using a 
      split() method function. Put the list of years from the HashMap into an Array and sort any character in front of
      your split() method into the first index of an array and anything after into the second index of that same array.
      Afterwards, compare the user-inputted year using greater than and less than signs. Be sure to include error 
      handling for if a President was not in office during the user-inputted year.
      
* President's sequence method: 

      This is a special function that will be in your assignment. Try to create a method that iterates through the HashMap 
      in order. If you are not able to do so, try to figure out why and explain what is preventing you from doing so.

For these parts, it is highly recommended that you reference the Java API on HashMaps in order to gain a better understanding on which methods to use.

### 🧊Assignment #20 (Algorithms and Thinking in Code): ▄︻デ3.15.2021══━一  

In this program, you are going to create an equation calculator that will solve for the value of a variable given in the correct format. 
There are three types of equations that the user can enter: 

1. Single-variable questions (Mx + N = C) --- Solve for x
2. Quadratic questions (Mx^2 + Nx + C = C1) --- Solve for x/find zeros
3. Simultaneous-equation questions (Mx + Ny = C) --- Solve for x and y.

Make this application quite generic so that you are not forcing users into using a specific format. They should be able to enter values like 

    4x   -6=32
or 

    5y+4=3 
    
You will want to utilize many string functions and capabilities like trim and split and scan for invalid values. In the end, display the result 
to the user with the value of their variables. 

* UNFINISHED: I got lazy writing this ... just refer to my code to see what I managed to come up with/my assignment.
