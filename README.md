### 🧊Assignment #2 (Introduction to While-Loops): ▄︻デ11.25.2021══━一
Prompt the user to enter a number between 1 and 10. Ensure that the user entered a number between one and ten, otherwise tell them it is not a valid number and exit the program.
If the user entered a valid number, print a string of asterisks equal to the number the user entered on the first line and in each subsequent line reduce the number of asterisks 
by one until the last line has only one asterisks remaining. For example if the user entered 4, the output should look like this (with asterisks):

    . . . . 
                 
    . . .
                 
    . .
                 
    .
Finally, print a goodbye message to the user and tell them how many stars were shown on the screen in total. For the above example it will be 10.

### 🧊Assignment #9 (Practice of Every Concept Reviewed So Far): ▄︻デ12.03.2021══━一
Prompt the user to enter the names of their friends, one by one. You want to get multiple inputs in multiple occurences, under the same scanner. Set up a while loop and exit the while loop if the user entered "exit". Inside that while loop, do the following:

- Print a message asking the user to enter their next friend's name (This should only be used after they have entered at least one input.
- Store the entered name as the next element in an arraylist.

Outside the while loop, return the list of the user's friends. If the user has more than five friends, return a message in which you seem impressed. If the user has one friend, congratulate them for having a best friend. If the user has zero friends, offer to be their friend.

### 🧊Assignment #10 (Introduction to Functions + Working w/ Larger LOC's): ▄︻デ12.06.21══一
This application is for Boston University to maintain a list of all its students.

You will need to create three arraylists: student name, student grade, student gpa.
* Inside a while loop:

   - Print a message saying "Welcome to the BU Student Inventory System".
   
   - Print a bunch of "*" as an underline to the welcome banner.
   
   - Print the message: "Type one of the menu options: 1. Add a student  2. Remove a Student  3. Change Student Details 4. Statistics 5. Exit"
   
   - Read the users input; the input has to be 1,2,3,4 or 5. If they enter an invalid value then display the message:
    "Invalid option chosen", and redisplay the menu options.
   
   - If the user selected 5, exit the loop and the entire program with the final message: "You have successfully exited the student maintenance system. Have a great day!".
   
   - If they selected 1, call the function for adding a student.
   
   - If they selected 2, call the function for removing a student.
   
   - If they selected 3, call the function for updating a student's details.
   
   - If they selected 4, call the function for reporting the key statistics of the student body.
 
End of the loop.

* The add student function should do the following:

   - Print the message: "Adding new student. Please enter student's full name: ", and read the student name from user input and add it to the student name arraylist.
   
   - Print the message: "Please enter student's grade (between 9th and 12th grade): ", and read the student grade from user input and add it to the student grade
    arraylist after checking that it is a valid grade for BU.
    
   - Check that the input is between 9 and 12. If the input is outside that value, then add the student to 9th grade by default. 
   
   - Print the message: "Please enter the student's GPA (between 0 and 5.0): ", and read the GPA from the user input and add it to the gpa arraylist.
   
   - If the entered value is outside of 0 - 5.0, then set it to 3.5 by default.

* The remove student function should do the following:

  - Print the message: "Please enter the name of the student to be removed from BU:" and read the student fullname.
  
  - Search the student name arraylist to find the student name. If it does not exist in the list, then display the message: "Student NOT removed. 
   The student you entered is not enrolled in BU at this point", and exit the function.
  
  - If the student name exists in the arraylist, remove that element from the student name, student grade and gpa arraylists, and display the message:
   "Student successfully removed BU. We wish them the best!".

* The change student function should do the following:

    - Print the message: "Please enter the name of the student to be removed from BU: " and read the student fullname.
    
    - Search the student name arraylist to find the student name. If it does not exist in the list, display the message: "Student not found. The name 
     you entered does not belong to a student who is currently enrolled in BU at this point", and exit the function.
    
    - If the student name exists in the arraylist, print the message: "Please enter student's grade to change (between 9th and 12th grade): ", and read the 
     student grade from user input and update the student grade arraylist after checking if it is a valid grade for BU. 
      
    - Check that the input is between 9 and 12. If the input is outside that value, do not make any changes.
    
    - Print the message: "Please enter the student's GPA to change (between 0 and 5.0): ", and read the GPA from the user input and update the gpa arraylist after checking
      if it is a valid GPA for BU.
    
    - If the value is outside of 0 - 5.0, set the new GPA to 3.5 by default.
   
    - Print the message: "Student details successfully updated".

* The report stats function should do the following:

    - Print the message: "Here are the details of the students attending BU!".
    
    - Print the message: "These are the students who are performing well in school: ", and read through the three arraylists while searching for any students 
     with a GPA >= 4.0. 
    
    - At the end, display: "The total number of students with a GPA of 4.0 or better is: " + count. If there were none, display: "Unfortunately there are
     no students with a high GPA at this time at BU".
  
   - Print the message: "The average GPA of all BU students is: " + average. 
  
   - Print the message: "Total number of students currently enrolled at BU is: " + total student count.

### 🧊Assignment #14 (Reading and Locating Files from Harddrive): ▄︻デ1.31.2021══━一  
Create a text file and store it on your computer with the following values: 

                {Australia, Canberra},
                {New Zealand, Wellington},
                {China, Beijing},
                {USA, Washington DC},
                {UK, London},

                {Japan, Tokyo},
                {Sri Lanka, Colombo},
                {Fiji, Suva},

Iterate through the text file in your code, row by row; store each row in an arraylist. You should have an arraylist for the name of the country and an arraylist
for the name of the capital of that corresponding country. Prompt the user to enter a country, then scan through the capitals arraylist and print the respective capital of the country.

* Error Handling: If the user gave an input that is not a country in the file, inform them that the program does not recognize their input and ask them to try again.

### 🧊Assignment #16 (Introduction to Recursion): ▄︻デ2.07.2021══━一  
For this assignment, you can use both recursion and while/for loop. Begin by prompting the user to enter any number between 1 and 9. For the number entered, calculate the sum of each number raised to its equal power. For example,
if the user entered "3", your calculation process should goes as follows:

    (1^1 + 2^2 + 3^3)

or if they entered "5":

    (1^1 + 2^2 + 3^3 + 4^4 + 5^5)
    
As mentioned, first try building this using for/while loops, then do so using recursion. Your final answer should be the summation of your calculation.

### 🧊Assignment #17 (Listing Files in a User's Directory): ▄︻デ2.13.2021══━一  
Prompt the user to input a folder/directory name from their computer by copying the path file of any location of their choice, as showed below:

    "C:\Users\JohnLovesMacaroni\Downloads"

Once receiving a directory from the user's PC, list out all the files and sub-folders within that directory. Include an error handling within your code for when the directory that the user entered cannot be found.

* Note: Keep in mind that the function of this program is to simply display all the files in a certain location of the user's PC. Therefore, only the user can run this program on their on computer, as it is not possible to access someone else's files without administrative permissions.
