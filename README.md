### 🧊Assignment #1 (Introduction to For-Loops): ▄︻デ11.25.2021══━一
Prompt the user to give any number. Then, print a string of asterisks equal to the number the user inputted. For example, if the user entered 3, print three asterisks on that line (***).
Finally, print a goodbye message to the user and tell them how many stars were shown the screen.

### 🧊Assignment #2 (Introduction to While-Loops): ▄︻デ11.25.2021══━一
Prompt the user to enter a number between 1 and 10. Ensure that the user entered a number between one and ten, otherwise tell them it is not a valid number and exit the program.
If the user entered a valid number, print a string of asterisks equal to the number the user entered on the first line and in each subsequent line reduce the number of asterisks 
by one until the last line has only one asterisks remaining. For example if the user entered 4, the output should look like this (with asterisks):

. . . .

. . .

. .

.

Finally, print a goodbye message to the user and tell them how many stars were shown on the screen in total. For the above example it will be 10.

### 🧊Assignment #3 (Introduction to Arrays): ▄︻デ11.26.2021══━一
Prompt the user to enter three numbers (in separate prompts). These numbers can be integers, real numbers, or positive/negative numbers. Take the numbers 
the user inputted and store them in an array. Then, produce an output in one row the three numbers the user input separated by a ",". On the next line
print the sum of the array. On the following line print the average of the array. Finally, thank them for their time.

### 🧊Assignment #4 (Introduction to Nested For-Loops): ▄︻デ11.27.2021══━一

Print a message telling the user that you will produce a square of any size in their choice of character. Ask the user to input the size of the 
square (this should be a number). Then ask the user to input the character they want their square to be made of. Produce a square in the character the user inputted. 
For example, if the the user inputted "3" and "$", the output should look like this:

$$$

$$$

$$$

### 🧊Assignment #5 (Additional For and While-Loop Practice): ▄︻デ11.27.2021══━一

Prompt the user to enter any positive integer. Then display the numbers from one to the user-inputted integer using a for loop and a while loop (in two separate sections).
For example, if the user inputted 11, the output should look like this:

1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11
